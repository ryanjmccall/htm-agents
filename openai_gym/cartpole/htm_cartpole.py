"""HTM Agent for "Cart-Pole-v0" environment from OpenAI Gym.
The system is controlled by applying a force of +1 or -1 to the cart. The
pendulum starts upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over. A
reward of +1 is provided for every time step that the pole remains upright. The
episode ends when the pole is more than 15 degrees from vertical, or the cart
moves more than 2.4 units from the center.

See https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/CartPole-v0 and
